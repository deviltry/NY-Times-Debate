		When called to serve jury, I'm asked as to group membership and I mention I'm a member of the ACLU.  
		I'm always expelled from the pool as if I had rabies and other jurists may catch whatever I have.  
		Is the ACLU tampering with me?  Am I tampering with others in the room?

		This is simply hysteria arising out of a period of turmoil. When the public feels powerless, as they now, they are sitting ducks for the "elegant solution”. The elegant solution is something that can be explained in simple terms and gives hope to the masses that they might regain power over their lives. I won't go into hyperbole here, but the 20th century is full of elegant political theories gone badly. The 21st century has already shown a number of elegant economic theories gone bad as well, to which our current economic state attests. So now the public is being told that if you let the government go bankrupt then something really good will come from that. The proponents are a little short on what that goodness will be.

Tea Party/republicans may be able to make that happen, but it will be like the day after someone predicts the end of the world. They are going to look pretty dumb. But, the solution is not going to be their problem because voters will forget they bought the pyramid scheme themselves and will turn them out at the first opportunity. The truth is there are no elegant solutions. If you’re not up to the hard work then don’t stick your hand up for a leadership position in politics.

		For the second week in a row, Frank you make scant mention of the labor fight in Wisconsin and that is a mistake. What that situation has exposed is that conservatives have no moral dilemma at all using a head fake of reasonable fiscal responsibility to actually run a play of gleeful vindictiveness against those who aren't in their "base."

I've always made it a practice to avoid vindictive people, so it's horrifying to find that so many have found their way into public service. It's like the Mean Girls from high school are running the country -- only most of them are puffy middle-aged men who are even more self-absorbed.	</div>
